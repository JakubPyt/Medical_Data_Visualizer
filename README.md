# Medical_Data_Visualizer
This project was carried out as part of the course on the free Code Camp website:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer

In this project, I had to visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, pandas and numpy.
